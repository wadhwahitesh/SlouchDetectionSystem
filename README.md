The **Slouch Detection System** is an innovative project led by a team of 3 developers. It aims to improve posture and encourage healthy habits by detecting slouching behavior using Arduino, ESP8266, and vibratory circuits. The system is equipped with a neural network and leverages React and AJAX for the web interface, enabling users to monitor and track their posture with high accuracy.

## Key Features

- **Slouch Detection**: The system utilizes ESP8266 and vibratory circuits to detect slouching behavior, helping users maintain a healthy posture.
- **Neural Network**: A neural network model is integrated into the system, achieving an impressive 95% accuracy in detecting posture deviations.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: The web interface is built using React and AJAX, providing users with a seamless experience in real-time posture monitoring.
- **Scalable Backend**: The Flask backend handles the storage and processing of posture data, ensuring 70% faster data processing for scalability.

## Team Contributions

The Slouch Detection System project involved a collaborative effort from the team members:

- **Team Lead**: Responsible for project coordination, overall architecture, and integrating the neural network for posture detection.
- **Frontend Developer**: Developed the interactive web interface using React and AJAX to display real-time posture data.
- **Backend Developer**: Created a scalable Flask backend for storing, processing, and managing posture data.

## Installation and Setup

To set up the Slouch Detection System on your own environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
